Using a development platform/language of your choosing, write an application that does the following: 

• Allows a user to enter multiple sentences of text

• Includes a button that the user can click after entering their desired text

• When the user clicks the button, the application analyzes the text (that was entered by the user) and displays (to the user) the number of occurrences of each letter of the alphabet.
